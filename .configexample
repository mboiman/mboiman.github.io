My main interest is education and I like to teach others the knowledge I have learnt myself. I have also tutored Mathematics privately. I also excel with technology. When I was 14 I emailed Nintendo asking what I needed to learn to make games. So from an early age I developed a strong interest in technology and began by learning the C++ programming language at approximately the age of 14 and learning GNU/Linux from the age of 15. I love pentesting with Kali Linux and Metasploit (ethical hacking). I am also fascinated by digital art creation in 3d and 2d and the application of Physics and Mathematics to create interactive art like videogames and simulations. I eventually developed a love for the Ruby programming language and in particular Ruby-on-Rails. I have developed a 3d Map App using Unity3d for iOS/Android/OSX/Windows 10. I discovered three confirmed bugs in Unity3d, which I was rewarded for by Unity. I have coached minority groups how to code (they taught me much more than I taught them). I am working on an off-grid P2P project which has a focus on education called QALB."

Andrew is a conscientious, willing, polite and cooperative member of our IT support team. He is keen to learn new skills as well as practising his well developed programming skills. He has been responsible for IT support in our fully wireless BYOD environment and has shown himself to be responsive, adaptable and effective in resolving a whole range of issues, such as administering the VLE and VLE outreach, fixing students laptops and problem solving computer and projector issues around the site. He has trained teachers in the use of the VLE. He communicates well with a variety of audiences and has shown himself to be persistent and determined in addressing the concerns of our users. Andrew has used his programming skills to good effect and has designed and built a Ruby-on-Rails (version 5) WebGL 3d Map App of the school which is published on GitHub https://github.com/YateleySchool/YSMap3d-Rails. He also designed and built a Ruby-on-Rails (version 4) Work Experience database system, which helped our work experience manager immensely.

After a decade of research and development this is now being actively developed. QALB will be released under the AGPLv3 once it is ready. The desert Bedouin of Makkah and Madinah who asked me for my help in 2007, confirmed the need for me to build a free software education platform; their kindness and generosity left a mark on me. People who give whatever they have — despite having very little to give. One day I hope to give something back to them — for all of their generosity and kindness. The main motivation behind QALB is to reflect on my own personal struggles with advanced knowledge and to help others not to suffer the way I did when trying to learn this knowledge. The stories and talks will be freely licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0, to reach as many people as possible. Despite being built on top of GNU/Linux, support for macOS and Windows is planned via QEMU and WSL2. I want to reach as many people as possible regardless of what technology they use. I plan to support x86_64 and arm64 initially. The art style of the animated stories is heavily inspired by Dédouze and also by Tyson Tan’s original friendly dragon concept. The gamified learning is happening via the Bevy game engine. The game development will use PlayStation 5 (and 4) controllers via SDL as the main recommended gamepad, with others to follow. QALB’s gamified learning concept was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto’s Ocarina of Time and also by Rare’s Banjo-Kazooie."
